# Li-ion-Battery-Electrical-Modeling

The purpose of this project was to model the electrical behavior of the battery that our team uses (Aristotle University Racing Team Electric - ARISTURTLE). Modeling of the battery requires the calculation of the state of charge of the cells and the knowlegde of the cells' voltages for various currents amplitudes. In parallel, during this process, we took into consideration the variations in the cell capacitance, energy and internal resistance.

For the modeling of the battery, we used the equivalent electrical circuit that is shown below.
